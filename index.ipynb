    "As with your previous machine learning work, you should be asking a couple of questions:\n",
    "- Is there high bias? yes/no\n",
    "- Is there high variance? yes/no \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use the a train-validate-test partition as well as a validation set to get better insights of how to tune neural networks using regularization techniques. You'll start by repeating the process from the last section: importing the data and performing preprocessing including one-hot encoding. From there, you'll define and compile the model like before. However, this time, when you are presented with the `history` dictionary of the model, you will have additional data entries for not only the train and test set but also the validation set.\n",
